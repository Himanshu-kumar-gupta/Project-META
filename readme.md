# Purpose of the Project 
> 
>Amidst these times of global medical emergency, there needs to be a system for proper storage and management of information of covid and non-covid patients. This becomes even more important problem to address especially in hospitals located in remote areas. The reason for the same is that these areas have limited connectivity to internet and other resources. In most of the hospitals that are located in the remote areas the data is stored in the physical logbooks which usually consists of notebooks/registers. This indeed was one of the major reasons that gave rise to the problem of missing information of some of the admitted patients as well as some of the deceased patients due to Covid-19. This was one of the major problems that got all the headlines during this pandemic period. This project addresses this problem by storing and managing the information of patients using the concept of file handling in C-Language. The records of the patients are stored in multiple files.

>Another major ongoing problem that the medical sector is facing these days is the problem of overcrowding due to increase in the number of patients visiting the hospital due to current ongoing pandemic. The significant point to note here is that hospitals are not factories and they should not operate above their maximum capacity. Overcrowding also adds up to the number of covid cases due to failure in following the proper social distancing norms that are issued by the ministry of the health care department. This project addresses this major problem of overcrowding by keeping track of number of patients present in the hospital at any point of time making sure that the hospitals and individuals adhere to the covid guidelines.

>The data which is being stored in the form of records in a file can be analyzed by the local hospital staff or the data analysts at any point of time to get the real time analysis of the present status of the hospital. Some of the analysis includes analyzing the active number of covid patients, total number of covid patients, total number of records, searching for a particular record etc. The analysis will in turn help the hospitals to analyze the covid trends, and prepare themselves accordingly for the future medical emergency scenarios.

>This project is implemented using the core concepts of C-Programming Language which majorly includes the concept of file handling.
